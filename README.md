## Simple app that allows you to share any text link into it, categorize it and keep it locally for future reading.

## build with Kotlin, applying SOLID principles and using the Clean Architecture approach. I also implement the Model View ViewModel design pattern, which abstracts the user interactions from the business logic. Additionally, I used coroutines for Asynchronous tasks, Room to save the links and categories and Material Components for the "design" and user experience of the app.
