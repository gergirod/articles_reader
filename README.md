### Simple app that allows you to share any text link into it, categorize it and keep it locally for future reading.

Build with __Kotlin__, applying **SOLID** principles and using the **Clean Architecture** approach.
I also implement the **Model View ViewModel** design pattern, which abstracts the user interactions from the business logic. Additionally, I used **coroutines** for Asynchronous tasks, **Room** to save the links and categories and **Material Components** for the "design" and user experience of the app.
